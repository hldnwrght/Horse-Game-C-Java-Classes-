HW 3 Algorithm
Goal: To use Java and C plus plus to create a game of horse using more than one source code and classes.
Output: It will output each individual shot and if they made it or not, then after the missed shot the letter that is added is displayed.
Requirements: Use C++ and java to create the game Horse, must make use of classes and objects.
Problems -> sub Problems:
* Create class Player
* Loop until one player completes HORSE
* Create a rand function from 1 to 2 to see if player makes the shot or not.
* If either both make it or don’t make it continues the game until one makes it and one does not.
* Create destructors to prevent memory leaks
* When program has completed prompt user to enter Y:N to redo the program.
Step by Step:
1. Begin the program by greeting the user.
2. Assign values to player 1 and player 2 as well as create local variables for looping.
3. Create a nested do while within a while loop
4. For the do start by assigning a value to a variable and retrieve a random 2 numbers to see if the player makes the shot or not.
5. Have 4 if statements: 1 for if player 1 makes it, 1 for if player 2 makes it, 1 for if they both make it, and 1 for if neither make it.
6. When one player misses enough shots to spell horse the do while loop exits.
7. Delete any and all heap allocated variables
8. Prompt the user if they want to do it again or not
